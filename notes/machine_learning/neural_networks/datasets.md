## Datasets Description  

When deploying neural networks in aerodynamic applications, assembling high-quality datasets is crucial for both model training and validation. In most cases, these datasets must encompass a range of geometrical variations and flow conditions so that the trained model can generalize to new or modified configurations. Although the overarching goal varies by project, a common objective is to predict aerodynamic properties such as the drag coefficient $C_d$, lift coefficient $C_l$, or full flow fields in response to changes in the vehicle (or other aerodynamic body) geometry.

### Design of Experiments (DoE)  

A typical dataset for aerodynamic neural networks arises from systematic variation of certain geometry features. This might include adding new parts (e.g., spoilers, roof racks), altering existing parts’ dimensions (e.g., bumper shape, underbody configuration), changing entire sections of the body (e.g., hood and windshield angles), and testing experimental concepts that deviate substantially from baseline designs. These variations ensure coverage of a broad design space:

I. **Geometry-Driven Changes**  
   - Front bumper modifications  
   - Side mirror relocations or shape changes  
   - Tire profile alterations  
   - Rear spoiler installations  
   - Roof racks and other external accessories  
II. **Flow-Driven Changes**  
   - Variation in Reynolds number  
   - Variation in inlet velocity profiles  
   - Different turbulence intensities or swirl ratios  

By combining these perturbations, the resultant dataset spans a wide spectrum of aerodynamic configurations. This is essential for training robust models that can predict flow behavior under many design modifications and operating conditions.

### Typical CFD Foundations  

Each dataset entry generally comes from Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) simulations or another CFD approach (e.g., LES for certain complex flow features). These CFD runs are performed on either in-house or cloud-based high-performance computing (HPC) clusters. In many industrial or research contexts:

$$\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x}), \quad p(\mathbf{x}), \quad \dots$$
are solved for on a mesh that discretizes the domain around the geometry, subject to specific boundary conditions (often approximating standard atmospheric or wind-tunnel conditions). Once a target number of simulation cases (e.g., a few hundred or thousand) has been generated, the data typically undergoes a train/test (and sometimes validation) split, such as 90% of the samples used for training and 10% for testing.

### Legacy vs. Newly Generated Data  

Researchers or engineers often merge legacy data—previously obtained for other design studies—with newly generated CFD cases in order to expand the coverage of the geometry and flow parameter space. This approach can expedite dataset creation, but it also raises questions about data consistency (different grid resolutions, turbulence models, or slightly different boundary conditions). Proper data preprocessing and normalization are therefore critical steps to ensure a coherent dataset.

## Dataset Overview  

Below is an illustrative example of how datasets might be organized in a tabular form. Each row corresponds to a set of simulations performed on a particular baseline model, detailing which geometry features were changed and the associated operating conditions.

| Dataset ID | Vehicle Model | Variant Description             | Geometry Changes                              | Simulation Conditions                    |
|------------|---------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1          | Vehicle A     | Baseline Model                  | None                                          | Standard atmospheric conditions          |
| 2          | Vehicle A     | Modified Front Bumper           | Front bumper altered                          | Standard atmospheric conditions          |
| 3          | Vehicle A     | Additional Rear Spoiler         | Rear spoiler added                            | Standard atmospheric conditions          |
| 4          | Vehicle A     | Altered Side Mirrors            | Side mirrors changed                          | Standard atmospheric conditions          |
| 5          | Vehicle A     | Changes in Underbody Design     | Underbody geometry altered                    | Standard atmospheric conditions          |
| 6          | Vehicle A     | Different Tire Profiles         | Tire profiles changed                         | Standard atmospheric conditions          |
| 7          | Vehicle A     | Roof Rack Added                 | Roof rack added                               | Standard atmospheric conditions          |
| ...        | ...           | ...                             | ...                                           | ...                                      |

This table can be extended to include additional columns for parameters such as Reynolds number, inlet velocity magnitude, or yaw angle if the study focuses on crosswind scenarios. Each “Variant Description” tag serves as a shorthand reference to more detailed geometry and flow specification notes.

## Decimation Workflow  

Once the high-resolution CFD data has been collected, it is common to reduce (or “decimate”) both the geometry and flow field representations to suit the memory and computational constraints of neural-network training. The goals here are:

I. **Maintain Critical Features**  

   Ensure that key aerodynamic features—such as leading edges, separation points, and high-curvature regions—remain adequately represented.

II. **Reduce Data Density**  

   Large meshes (with millions of cells or more) must be coarsened to a manageable level for GPU-based neural network training. A balance between retaining fidelity and limiting memory footprint is essential.

### Geometry Decimation  
- **Mesh Reduction**  
  Suppose the original surface mesh contains $N$ points. A decimation algorithm might reduce this to $\alpha N$ points (commonly $\alpha \approx 0.1$ or another fraction).  
- **Uniform Spacing**  

  The routine typically ensures that the remaining points are uniformly distributed, attempting to preserve important geometric features. This can be done via edge collapse methods, clustering, or other mesh-simplification algorithms. Mathematically, one might formulate a minimization of the local error metric:

  $$\min_{\text{decimated mesh}} \sum_{\text{original points}} \|\mathbf{x}_{\text{original}} - \mathbf{x}_{\text{decimated}}\|^2,$$
  subject to constraints that maintain geometry topology.

### Flow Field Interpolation  
- **Variable Mapping**  
  Pressure $p$, velocity components $\mathbf{u} = (u, v, w)$, and potentially other quantities (e.g., turbulence kinetic energy $k$) are interpolated onto the new, coarser set of mesh points.  
- **Preservation of Essential Flow Structures**  
  To minimize loss in fidelity, one might use higher-order interpolation schemes or special handling near boundary layers and separation regions.  
- **Tradeoff**  

  A finer decimated mesh leads to better flow-field resolution but larger memory usage. Conversely, an excessively coarse mesh may exclude crucial aerodynamic details, degrading the neural network’s learning capability.

### Practical Considerations  
- **Symmetry**  
  In many vehicle or wing cases, flow may be symmetric about a central plane. Consequently, one can use a half-model to halve the data volume.  
- **Reference Frames**  
  Geometries might be aligned in a consistent coordinate system (e.g., $x$-axis in the longitudinal direction, $y$-axis in the lateral direction, $z$-axis vertically). Standardizing these frames simplifies subsequent data processing.  
- **Number of Samples vs. Mesh Resolution**  

  Engineers must balance the number of distinct geometries (dataset size) against the resolution per geometry. A rough rule of thumb might be:

  $$\text{Total memory usage} \;\approx\; (\text{# of samples}) \times (\text{points per sample}) \times (\text{variables}).$$

  Ensuring this total is feasible on available hardware is critical to a successful decimation strategy.

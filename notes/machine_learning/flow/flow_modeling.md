# Flow Modeling with Machine Learning

Flow modeling has traditionally relied on first principles, particularly conservation laws. However, as the Reynolds numbers increase, scale-resolving simulations based on the Navier-Stokes equations become impractical due to computational limitations. Machine Learning (ML) offers new possibilities for addressing these challenges.

## Challenges in Traditional Flow Modeling

- **High Computational Cost**:
  - Simulating high Reynolds number flows is resource-intensive.
  - Navier-Stokes equations require immense computational resources.
- **Approximations and Experiments**:
  - Turbulence modeling and laboratory experiments are costly and time-consuming.
  - Iterative optimization adds to the expense and time.
- **Real-Time Control**:
  - Traditional simulations often lack the speed required for real-time applications.

## Need for Reduced-Order Models

- **Objective**:
  - Capture essential flow mechanisms at a reduced computational cost.
- **Benefits**:
  - More efficient simulations.
  - Feasible for real-time applications.

## Role of Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) provides a compact framework that extends existing methodologies for flow modeling.

### Key Concepts in ML for Fluid Mechanics

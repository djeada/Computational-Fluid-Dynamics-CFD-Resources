# Machine Learning on CAD

Interacting with **Computer-Aided Design (CAD)** models through machine learning can open doors to faster, more flexible design workflows. While direct simulation remains computationally costly, machine learning models can create **compressed representations** of CAD objects, speeding up tasks like shape classification, similarity searches, and even geometry generation. Achieving this, however, demands extensive training data, often requiring simulation software and large-scale data processing to ensure models capture the full complexity of engineered shapes.

   Traditional CAD Workflow:
       Design -> Manual Edits -> Simulation -> Refine -> Final Model
          (Time-consuming, expertise-dependent)

   ML-Augmented Workflow:
       Text/Parameters -> ML Model -> Suggested CAD Geometry -> Validate/Refine
          (Faster iteration, knowledge reuse)

## Practical Application: CAD Data Generation from Text

Bridging the gap between textual descriptions and CAD geometries offers enormous potential. Imagine specifying "a car-like shape with a streamlined body and four wheels" and receiving a coarse CAD model ready for refinement. Realizing this vision involves integrating **natural language processing (NLP)** with **3D geometry processing** and **generative models** for shape creation.

### CAD Data Generation Pipeline

1. **Data Mining and Labeling**:  
   Start by collecting a rich database of CAD models representing a variety of shapes, from simple boxes to complex automotive bodies. Each model should come with metadata describing geometric features such as edges, faces, and the **center of gravity (COG)**. Manually annotating these models with relevant **keywords** (e.g., "car," "box," "wing") helps create a training set linking text to geometry.

2. **Feature Extraction**:  
   Once data is annotated, extract **geometric properties** (like volume, surface area), **topological properties** (edge-face connectivity), and possibly **physical properties** (mass distribution) if available. These features, along with any known parameters (e.g., shape complexity), form the input space for ML.

3. **Text-to-Geometry Mapping**:  
   Develop algorithms that translate textual descriptions into geometric constraints. NLP converts text into embeddings, capturing the meaning of phrases like "boxy structure" or "car body." The ML model then maps these embeddings to geometric features, effectively learning a function from language to shape descriptors.

4. **Generative Modeling**:  
   With text embeddings guiding the generation, use **generative models** such as **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** or **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)** to create new CAD geometries. Over time, the model refines its internal representation, producing shapes that closely align with textual inputs.

## Detailed Steps for Implementation

**Data Collection and Labeling** involves gathering a large, diverse set of CAD models. Each model might be stored in a standard format (e.g., STEP, IGES) and accompanied by metadata. Annotating them with keywords ensures the model learns meaningful correlations (e.g., "car" often correlates with wheels and curved surfaces).

**Feature Extraction** translates raw CAD files into mathematically digestible formats. This may involve computing **geometric descriptors** (lengths, angles), **topological descriptors** (how faces connect), and even **physical properties** (center of gravity if defined). These features bridge the gap between raw polygon data and the structured input ML models require.

**Training the Model** requires a careful setup. Start by using supervised learning to correlate given text descriptions with known CAD features. Over time, the model learns patterns: words like "rounded" might correlate with a set of curvature descriptors, while "boxy" might correlate with rectangular volumes or sharp edges. Validation with hold-out sets ensures the model can generalize to unseen descriptions and shapes.

**Generating Geometry from Text** uses the trained model to produce new CAD concepts from scratch. Embedding textual input, such as a design brief, into a latent space lets the generative model produce a mesh or a parametric description of geometry that matches the requested characteristics. Additional post-processing might convert a rough initial shape into a fully parametric CAD model.

## Recommended Algorithms and Techniques

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:  
For handling text, models like **Word2Vec** or **BERT** create vector embeddings capturing semantic meaning. Descriptions like "aerodynamic body" or "sturdy base" become numerical vectors that the model can map to geometric features.

**Neural Networks for Geometry**:  
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at analyzing images or voxelized shapes. For CAD, 3D CNNs or graph-based neural networks might process polygon meshes or point clouds. Some approaches convert CAD models into multi-view images, letting 2D CNNs extract features from multiple rendered viewpoints.

**Generative Models**:  
GANs pit a generator (producing shapes) against a discriminator (judging plausibility), refining geometry iteratively. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) map shapes to a latent space, enabling smooth interpolation between geometric concepts. Conditional versions of these models use textual embeddings as constraints, steering the generated geometry towards desired characteristics.

**Supervised Learning**:  
Initial mapping from text descriptions to geometric descriptors often involves supervised learning, where models learn from pairs of (text, known geometry). Regression or classification techniques can predict continuous shape parameters (e.g., dimensions) or discrete labels (e.g., presence of certain features).

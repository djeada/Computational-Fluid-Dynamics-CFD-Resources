# Machine Learning on CAD

Machine learning (ML) models for practical interactions with CAD (Computer-Aided Design) models require substantial training data. These models do not create simulations themselves but offer a "compressed model" that can accurately represent a simulation with increased runtime speed, albeit with very large training times. Typically, simulation software is used to generate the necessary training data.

## Practical Application
### CAD Data Generation from Text
I am developing a platform for automated generation of CAD geometries from text data. Here's a comprehensive approach to achieving this:

1. **Data Mining and Preparation**
    - Mine CAD data which includes edges, faces, and additional parameters like the center of gravity (COG).
    - Manually label the data with keywords (e.g., car, box).

2. **Algorithm Development**
    - Create an algorithm that links keywords to geometries, possibly using techniques like heatmaps.

### Steps for Implementation

1. **Data Collection and Labeling**
    - Gather a diverse set of CAD models.
    - Extract geometrical features such as edges, faces, vertices, and COG.
    - Annotate each model with relevant keywords describing the geometry (e.g., "car," "box").

2. **Feature Extraction**
    - Use feature extraction techniques to capture the characteristics of each CAD model. This may involve:
        - Geometric properties (e.g., volume, surface area).
        - Topological properties (e.g., connectivity of edges and faces).
        - Physical properties (e.g., material properties).

3. **Training the Model**
    - Train a neural network to map from the text descriptions to the geometric features. This involves:
        - Using labeled data to train the network.
        - Applying supervised learning techniques.
        - Evaluating the model's performance and iterating to improve accuracy.

4. **Generating Geometry from Text**
    - Develop a model to generate CAD geometry from text descriptions. Steps include:
        - Text preprocessing: Tokenize and embed the text into a numerical format.
        - Geometry generation: Use generative models (e.g., GANs, VAEs) to produce CAD models based on the text embeddings.

## Recommended Algorithms and Techniques

1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
    - Tokenization and embedding (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT) to convert text into a format suitable for machine learning models.

2. **Neural Networks**
    - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from 3D models.
    - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers for handling sequential text data.

3. **Generative Models**
    - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for generating new CAD geometries from text descriptions.

4. **Supervised Learning**
    - Regression or classification algorithms to map text descriptions to specific geometric features.

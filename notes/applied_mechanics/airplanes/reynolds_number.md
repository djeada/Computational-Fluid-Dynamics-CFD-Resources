## The Reynolds Number 

The Reynolds number (Re) is a fundamental concept in aerodynamics, as it tells us whether the airflow around an object is smooth (laminar) or turbulent. In simpler terms, it’s a way to measure how different forces (like speed, size, and air viscosity) affect how air flows around something, whether that’s an insect, bird, or airplane.

The formula for calculating the Reynolds number is:

$$Re = \frac{\rho \cdot V \cdot L}{\mu}$$

Where:

- $\rho$ is the air density (kg/m³),
- $V$ is the velocity or airspeed (m/s),
- $L$ is the characteristic length, often the chord length of the wing (m),
- $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of air (kg/m·s).

As you increase either the speed or the size of an object, the Reynolds number also increases, which typically means the airflow becomes more turbulent. For example, an airliner flying at 250 m/s will have a much larger Reynolds number compared to a bird flying at 10 m/s, because the airplane is both faster and larger.

### Flight Airspeed and Mach Number

On the chart’s left side, you’ll see airspeed in meters per second (m/s) and knots. Airspeed is simply how fast the object is moving through the air. As you move up the Y-axis, the speed increases from very slow speeds for things like insects and birds, all the way to extremely fast speeds for supersonic jets and military aircraft.

The right side shows the **Mach number (M)**, which represents the speed of an object relative to the speed of sound in the air. When an object is flying at Mach 1, it is traveling at the speed of sound (about 343 m/s at sea level). If an object’s Mach number is less than 1, it’s flying below the speed of sound (subsonic); if greater than 1, it’s faster than sound (supersonic).

The Mach number is calculated as:

$$M = \frac{V}{a}$$

Where:

- $V$ is the velocity of the object (m/s),
- $a$ is the speed of sound in the medium (air), which depends on temperature.

For instance, an airliner typically cruises at Mach 0.8, just below the speed of sound. The Concorde, a famous supersonic passenger jet, cruised at Mach 2, meaning it traveled twice as fast as sound.

### Flight Regimes

Different types of aircraft or objects fit into certain regions on the chart, depending on their speed and size. These regions help us understand the unique challenges and characteristics of their flight. Here are some examples:

I. **Insects and Dust Particles**  

Found at the lower left part of the chart, insects and dust particles have low Reynolds numbers because they are small and fly slowly. Their motion is dominated by laminar, smooth airflow. They experience minimal turbulence, and air behaves more like a thick fluid to them.

II. **Birds and Hang Gliders**  

Moving toward the middle of the chart, birds and hang gliders operate at slightly higher speeds (5–20 m/s) and higher Reynolds numbers, often between $10^3$ and $10^5$. While their flight still involves laminar flow, they might experience some transition to turbulence, especially at higher speeds.

III. **General Aviation and Airliners**  

Aircraft like small planes and airliners occupy the region where speeds are much higher (around 100–300 m/s) and Reynolds numbers exceed $10^6$. This is where airflow becomes much more turbulent, and aerodynamic forces like lift and drag become critical to maintaining stable flight.

IV. **Supersonic and Hypersonic Flight**  

Military jets and the Concorde are shown at the top right, with Mach numbers greater than 1. In this region, the air becomes compressible, meaning the plane is moving so fast that it pushes air into shock waves. This is where advanced aerodynamics is necessary to overcome the effects of drag and heat from air compression.

### Understanding the Boundaries

The chart also includes horizontal lines that mark the boundaries between key flight regimes:

I. **Incompressible Flow**  

At low speeds (below Mach 0.3), air behaves as if its density remains constant. This regime is where most general aviation and birds fly.

II. **Transonic Flow**  

As speeds approach Mach 1 (around 343 m/s), the flow becomes compressible, and shock waves can form. This can cause instability, and it’s the regime where most airliners fly.

III. **Supersonic and Hypersonic Flow**  

Beyond Mach 1, the air compresses significantly, leading to shock waves. Hypersonic flow occurs when speeds exceed Mach 5, and this is relevant for certain military and space vehicles.

### Putting it All Together

So, how do you use this chart? If you want to understand how a particular object, such as a plane or even a bird, interacts with the air around it, you can look at its **airspeed** and estimate its **Reynolds number** based on its size (the chord length). For example, if you know an airliner typically flies at around Mach 0.8 and has a wing chord of several meters, you can find where it falls on the chart—close to the region for general aviation and airliners.

Similarly, if you’re studying insects, you’d see that they exist in a low-speed, low-Reynolds-number world where laminar flow dominates. Meanwhile, military jets or the Concorde, which fly much faster, deal with much more complex and turbulent airflow, as their Reynolds numbers are extremely high and their Mach numbers surpass 1.

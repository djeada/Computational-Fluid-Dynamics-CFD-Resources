# Fluid Loading on Structures

Fluid loading on structures is a critical aspect of applied mechanics where fluid forces act on solid structures, causing stress, deformation, and potentially dynamic responses. Unlike theoretical fluid-structure interaction, this section focuses on the practical engineering analysis of how fluid forces affect structural design and performance.

## What is Fluid Loading?

Fluid loading occurs when fluid forces act on structures, including:
1. **Static pressure forces** from hydrostatic pressure
2. **Dynamic pressure forces** from flowing fluids
3. **Viscous forces** from fluid friction
4. **Inertial forces** from fluid acceleration
5. **Oscillatory forces** from unsteady flows

### Engineering Perspective

From an applied mechanics standpoint, fluid loading analysis involves:
- **Force calculation**: Determining fluid forces on structural surfaces
- **Load distribution**: How forces are distributed over structure geometry  
- **Structural response**: Stress, strain, and deformation under fluid loads
- **Dynamic analysis**: Vibration and resonance under oscillatory loading
- **Design optimization**: Structural sizing for fluid load resistance

## Types of Fluid Loading

### 1. Hydrostatic Loading

**Static pressure** from fluid at rest:
$$p = \rho g h$$

**Applications**:
- Dam walls and retaining structures
- Submarine hulls and pressure vessels
- Underground tanks and pipelines
- Offshore foundation structures

#### Example: Hydrostatic Force on a Dam Wall
For a rectangular dam wall of width $w$ and height $H$:

**Pressure distribution**: Linear from 0 at top to $\rho g H$ at bottom
**Total force**: $F = \frac{1}{2}\rho g H^2 w$
**Center of pressure**: Located at $\frac{2H}{3}$ from bottom

### 2. Hydrodynamic Loading

**Dynamic pressure** from moving fluid:
$$p_{dynamic} = \frac{1}{2}\rho V^2$$

**Applications**:
- Wind loading on buildings and towers
- Water flow forces on bridge piers
- Ocean current loading on offshore platforms
- Aerodynamic forces on aircraft structures

### 3. Wave Loading

**Oscillatory forces** from surface waves:
- **Froude-Krylov forces**: Pressure from undisturbed wave field
- **Diffraction forces**: Modification due to structure presence
- **Radiation forces**: Fluid reaction to structure motion

**Morison Equation** for slender structures:
$$F = \rho \frac{\pi D^2}{4} C_M \dot{u} + \frac{1}{2}\rho D C_D |u-\dot{x}|(u-\dot{x})$$

where:
- $C_M$ = added mass coefficient
- $C_D$ = drag coefficient  
- $u$ = fluid velocity
- $\dot{x}$ = structure velocity

## Structural Response to Fluid Loading

### Static Analysis

For structures under steady fluid loading:

**Equilibrium equations**:
$$\sum F = 0, \quad \sum M = 0$$

**Stress analysis**:
$$\sigma = \frac{My}{I} + \frac{P}{A}$$

**Deflection analysis**:
$$\delta = \int_0^L \frac{M(x)}{EI} \phi(x) dx$$

### Dynamic Analysis

For structures under time-varying fluid loading:

**Equation of motion**:
$$m\ddot{x} + c\dot{x} + kx = F(t)$$

**Natural frequency**:
$$\omega_n = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$$

**Dynamic amplification factor**:
$$DAF = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(1-r^2)^2 + (2\zeta r)^2}}$$

where $r = \omega/\omega_n$ is frequency ratio.

## Example: Vortex-Induced Vibration of a Cylinder

Consider a circular cylinder in crossflow:

**Given:**
- Cylinder diameter: $D = 0.1$ m
- Flow velocity: $U = 2$ m/s
- Structural natural frequency: $f_n = 5$ Hz
- Fluid: Water ($\rho = 1000$ kg/mÂ³, $\nu = 10^{-6}$ mÂ²/s)

**Analysis:**

**Reynolds number:**
$$Re = \frac{UD}{\nu} = \frac{2 \times 0.1}{10^{-6}} = 2 \times 10^5$$

**Vortex shedding frequency:**
$$f_{vs} = St \frac{U}{D} = 0.2 \times \frac{2}{0.1} = 4 \text{ Hz}$$

**Reduced velocity:**
$$U_r = \frac{U}{f_n D} = \frac{2}{5 \times 0.1} = 4$$

**Assessment:** The vortex shedding frequency (4 Hz) is close to the structural natural frequency (5 Hz), indicating potential for lock-in and significant vibration amplitude.

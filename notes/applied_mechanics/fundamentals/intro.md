# Introduction to Applied Mechanics

Applied mechanics is the foundation of engineering analysis and design, providing the theoretical framework for understanding how forces, motion, and materials interact in real-world systems. It bridges the gap between pure physics and practical engineering, enabling engineers to predict, analyze, and optimize the behavior of structures, machines, and systems.

## What is Applied Mechanics?

Applied mechanics is the branch of mechanics that deals with the application of fundamental principles of physics to solve engineering problems. It encompasses the study of:

- **Forces and their effects** on bodies at rest and in motion
- **Material behavior** under various loading conditions
- **System response** to external influences
- **Optimization of design** for performance, safety, and efficiency

## Scope and Subdivisions

Applied mechanics traditionally divides into several interconnected fields:

### 1. Statics
The study of bodies in equilibrium, where the sum of forces and moments equals zero. Applications include:

$$\sum F = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \sum M = 0$$

- Structural analysis of buildings and bridges
- Design of support systems
- Force analysis in mechanisms

### 2. Dynamics
The study of bodies in motion, considering the relationship between forces and motion. Key areas:

**Kinematics**: Motion description without considering forces
- Position: $\mathbf{r}(t)$
- Velocity: $\mathbf{v}(t) = \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt}$
- Acceleration: $\mathbf{a}(t) = \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt}$

**Kinetics**: Motion analysis considering forces (Newton's Laws)
- $F = ma$ (Second Law)
- Action-reaction principle (Third Law)

### 3. Strength of Materials (Mechanics of Materials)
Analysis of stress, strain, and deformation in structural elements:

**Stress**: Force per unit area
$$\sigma = \frac{F}{A}$$

**Strain**: Relative deformation
$$\epsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0}$$

**Hooke's Law**: Linear relationship for elastic materials
$$\sigma = E\epsilon$$

where $E$ is the elastic modulus.

### 4. Fluid Mechanics
Study of fluid behavior and its interaction with solid boundaries:
- **Fluid statics**: Pressure distribution in static fluids
- **Fluid dynamics**: Flow analysis and forces on submerged bodies
- **Fluid-structure interaction**: Coupling between fluid flow and structural response

## Fundamental Principles

### Newton's Laws of Motion

1. **First Law (Inertia)**: A body remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force.

2. **Second Law**: The acceleration of a body is proportional to the net force and inversely proportional to its mass:
   $$\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a}$$

3. **Third Law**: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction:
   $$\mathbf{F}_{AB} = -\mathbf{F}_{BA}$$

### Conservation Laws

**Conservation of Mass**: 
$$\frac{dm}{dt} = 0 \quad \text{(for closed systems)}$$

**Conservation of Energy**:
$$E_{kinetic} + E_{potential} + E_{internal} = \text{constant}$$

**Conservation of Momentum**:
$$\mathbf{p} = m\mathbf{v} = \text{constant} \quad \text{(in absence of external forces)}$$

## Mathematical Tools

### Vector Analysis
Forces, velocities, and accelerations are vector quantities requiring vector mathematics:

**Vector Addition**: $\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}$

**Dot Product**: $\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = |\mathbf{A}||\mathbf{B}|\cos\theta$

**Cross Product**: $\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B} = |\mathbf{A}||\mathbf{B}|\sin\theta \, \hat{\mathbf{n}}$

### Differential Equations
Many mechanics problems involve differential equations:

**Simple Harmonic Motion**:
$$m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + kx = 0$$

Solution: $x(t) = A\cos(\omega t + \phi)$ where $\omega = \sqrt{k/m}$

### Calculus Applications
- **Integration**: For finding work, impulse, and center of mass
- **Differentiation**: For relating position, velocity, and acceleration
- **Partial derivatives**: For stress analysis and field problems

## Example: Simple Beam Analysis

Consider a simply supported beam with uniform load:

**Given**: 
- Beam length: $L = 6$ m
- Uniform load: $w = 10$ kN/m
- Material: Steel with $E = 200$ GPa
- Cross-section: $I = 8.33 \times 10^{-6}$ m⁴

**Find**: Maximum deflection

**Solution**:
1. **Reactions**: $R_A = R_B = wL/2 = 30$ kN

2. **Maximum moment**: $M_{max} = \frac{wL^2}{8} = 45$ kN⋅m

3. **Maximum deflection**: $\delta_{max} = \frac{5wL^4}{384EI} = 8.1$ mm

This example demonstrates the systematic approach: from load analysis to deflection calculation using beam theory.

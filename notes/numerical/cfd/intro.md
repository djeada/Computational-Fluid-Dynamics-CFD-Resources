# The Need for CFD

Applying the fundamental laws of mechanics to a fluid gives the governing equations for a fluid. These are essential for understanding and predicting fluid behavior in various engineering applications.

## Governing Equations

### Conservation of Mass
The conservation of mass equation is:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + 
abla \cdot (\rho \vec{V}) = 0
$$

### Conservation of Momentum
The conservation of momentum equation is:

$$
\rho \frac{\partial \vec{V}}{\partial t} + \rho (\vec{V} \cdot 
abla) \vec{V} = - 
abla p + \rho \vec{g} + 
abla \cdot \tau_{ij}
$$

These equations, along with the conservation of energy equation, form a set of coupled, nonlinear partial differential equations. Solving these equations analytically is not possible for most engineering problems due to their complexity.

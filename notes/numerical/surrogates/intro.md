# Surrogate Models in CFD

Surrogate models, also known as metamodels, are powerful tools used in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for approximating complex and computationally expensive simulations. These models provide a simplified representation of the original CFD model, allowing for faster analysis and optimization. This document provides an overview of surrogate models, their application in CFD, and how they compare with other numerical methods.

Surrogate models are used to replace detailed simulations with an approximation that can be evaluated much more quickly. In the context of CFD, surrogate models are employed to predict the outcomes of fluid flow problems without performing full-scale simulations every time. This is particularly useful in scenarios requiring numerous evaluations, such as optimization, uncertainty quantification, and real-time simulations.

## Detailed Description of Surrogate Models

### Key Concepts in Surrogate Models

1. **Training Data**: Generate a set of data points from the original CFD model to train the surrogate model.
2. **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate surrogate model type, such as polynomial regression, Kriging, radial basis functions, or neural networks.
3. **Model Fitting**: Fit the surrogate model to the training data by optimizing the model parameters to minimize prediction error.
4. **Validation**: Assess the accuracy of the surrogate model using a separate validation dataset or cross-validation techniques.

### Steps in Building a Surrogate Model

1. **Generate Training Data**:
    - Perform a series of CFD simulations to obtain a set of input-output pairs.
    - These pairs form the training dataset for the surrogate model.

2. **Choose a Surrogate Model Type**:
    - Select a model type based on the complexity of the problem and the available data.
    - Common types include polynomial regression, Kriging (Gaussian process regression), radial basis functions, and neural networks.

3. **Fit the Surrogate Model**:
    - Use the training data to fit the surrogate model by optimizing its parameters.
    - Techniques such as least squares fitting, maximum likelihood estimation, or gradient-based optimization may be used.

4. **Validate the Surrogate Model**:
    - Validate the model using a separate validation dataset or through cross-validation.
    - Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance by comparing its predictions to actual CFD simulation results.

5. **Use the Surrogate Model**:
    - Apply the surrogate model for fast predictions in optimization, uncertainty quantification, or real-time applications.
    - The surrogate model can provide quick approximations of the flow field, enabling efficient decision-making.

### Example: Application in CFD

1. **Data Collection**:
    - Perform CFD simulations of a complex flow problem to generate training data.
    - Collect input parameters (e.g., boundary conditions, geometry) and corresponding output results (e.g., pressure, velocity).

2. **Surrogate Model Development**:
    - Choose an appropriate surrogate model type and fit it to the collected data.
    - Validate the model to ensure it accurately represents the original CFD simulations.

3. **Application**:
    - Use the surrogate model to perform rapid evaluations for design optimization or sensitivity analysis.
    - Implement the model in real-time monitoring systems to predict flow behavior quickly.

## Viscosity and Viscous Flow

Fluids differ in how easily they flow, and this difference is largely dictated by viscosity. Viscosity can be thought of as a measure of a fluid’s internal resistance to deformation. A highly viscous fluid like honey resists motion and flows slowly, whereas a low-viscosity fluid like water flows more freely. At the molecular level, viscosity arises from intermolecular interactions and the transfer of momentum between fluid layers moving at different speeds. On a more tangible scale, viscosity determines how fluids respond to shear stresses, influencing everything from the shape of a water jet to the fuel efficiency of engines.

  
In simple terms, when layers of fluid slide past each other at different speeds, viscosity acts like a kind of internal friction. This friction dissipates energy, converts some of the fluid’s kinetic energy into heat, and enforces a velocity gradient across the flow. Without viscosity, fluids would not form smooth velocity profiles in pipes, and phenomena like boundary layers near walls would not exist. Instead, velocity would jump abruptly from zero at a solid boundary to some finite value away from it, which is not realistic for ordinary fluids.

 The gradient in speed across layers 
 introduces internal friction.
 Viscosity resists relative motion, 
 smoothing out velocity differences.

## Newtonian and Non-Newtonian Fluids

Viscosity can behave differently depending on the fluid. The simplest fluids are Newtonian, meaning their viscosity remains constant regardless of the applied shear rate. Water and air are common examples. More complex fluids are Non-Newtonian, with viscosities that change depending on the rate of shear deformation. For example, some paints become less viscous when stirred, making them easier to spread, and then thicken again when still.

If $\tau$ represents shear stress and $\dot{\gamma}$ represents shear rate (rate of strain), a Newtonian fluid satisfies:

$$\tau = \mu \dot{\gamma},$$

where $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity. For Newtonian fluids, $\mu$ is a constant under given conditions. Non-Newtonian fluids might follow more complicated relationships, with $\mu$ effectively changing as the shear rate changes.

## Temperature and Pressure Dependence

Viscosity often depends on temperature and pressure. For liquids, viscosity generally decreases as temperature rises because molecules can move past each other more easily. For gases, viscosity typically increases with temperature, since faster-moving molecules collide more often and transfer momentum more effectively between layers.

Pressure can also have an effect, though it is often less pronounced than temperature. Increasing pressure may force molecules closer together, potentially increasing viscosity, but this effect is usually weaker than the temperature dependence for most common fluids.

## Laminar and Turbulent Flow

Viscosity plays a crucial role in determining whether a flow is laminar or turbulent. In laminar flow, fluid moves in smooth layers or laminae, with little mixing between them. This type of flow is common at lower velocities or in highly viscous fluids. Turbulent flow, on the other hand, occurs at higher velocities or with lower viscosity. Here, fluid motion is chaotic, with swirling eddies and vortices that greatly increase mixing and momentum transfer.

The Reynolds number, a dimensionless quantity defined as:

$$Re = \frac{\rho U L}{\mu},$$

where $\rho$ is fluid density, $U$ a characteristic velocity, and $L$ a characteristic length scale, helps predict the flow regime. Low Reynolds numbers (small, slow flows or very viscous fluids) tend to be laminar, while high Reynolds numbers (fast flows or less viscous fluids) tend to be turbulent.

    Chaotic, mixing eddies.

## Boundary Layers and Viscous Effects

When fluids flow past solid surfaces, viscosity ensures the fluid adheres to the boundary, enforcing the no-slip condition that fluid at the wall has zero relative velocity. This creates a boundary layer: a thin region near the wall where velocity changes rapidly from zero at the surface to the free-stream value away from it. The thickness of this boundary layer and how quickly the velocity profile adjusts depend on viscosity. High-viscosity fluids develop thicker boundary layers, while low-viscosity fluids have thinner ones.

Boundary layers influence heat transfer, drag on objects, and the overall efficiency of fluid systems. Understanding and controlling boundary layers is vital in engineering, from designing streamlined aircraft wings to minimizing resistance in pipelines.

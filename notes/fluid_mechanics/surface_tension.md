## Surface Tension

Surface tension arises because molecules at a fluid interface experience an imbalance of intermolecular forces. While molecules in the bulk of a fluid are pulled equally in all directions by their neighbors, those at the surface have fewer neighbors on one side, causing a net inward attraction. This imbalance makes the fluid’s surface behave like a flexible membrane under tension, resisting increases in surface area. Although surface tension is often associated with liquids like water, gases can form interfaces too, and surface tension applies anywhere two distinct phases meet, including liquid-vapor or liquid-liquid interfaces.

At the macroscopic scale, surface tension can be observed through everyday phenomena. Water droplets tend to be spherical because that shape minimizes surface area for a given volume. Small insects can stand on water without sinking because the water’s surface acts like a stretched elastic film. Soap bubbles demonstrate surface tension vividly, with their thin liquid films holding together due to the cohesive forces at play.

## Intermolecular Forces and the Interface

At the molecular level, attractive forces between fluid molecules (cohesion) and between fluid and solid molecules (adhesion) determine how fluids interact with surfaces and each other. In a liquid, cohesive forces keep molecules together, while adhesion affects how the liquid spreads on a solid substrate. The difference in these forces at an interface gives rise to surface tension.

If a molecule at the interface tries to move outward, it must work against the cohesive forces pulling it inward. This energy cost leads to a preference for configurations where the interface area is as small as possible. For a given volume, a sphere has the least surface area. This is why droplets in free fall or in zero gravity tend to form spherical shapes.

  
## Defining Surface Tension

Surface tension is usually denoted by the symbol $\sigma$ (sometimes $\gamma$). It has units of force per unit length (N/m) or equivalently energy per unit area (J/m²). Conceptually, it can be thought of as how much force is needed to create or extend a unit length of line in the fluid’s surface, or how much energy is required to increase the surface area by one square meter.

A classical way to measure surface tension involves a device that pulls a small wire frame with a movable wire strip, creating a film of liquid. The force needed to pull this strip and increase the film’s surface area gives a direct measure of surface tension. Another common method is the pendant drop test, where analyzing the shape of a hanging droplet under gravity allows surface tension to be calculated.
  
## Effects of Surface Tension

Surface tension affects many aspects of fluid behavior, from the shapes of droplets to the rise of liquids in narrow tubes, known as capillarity. When a tube with a small internal diameter (capillary tube) is placed in a liquid, the combination of adhesion (between the fluid and the tube material) and cohesion (within the fluid) results in the liquid climbing up or depressing within the tube. The equilibrium height of this capillary rise is related to surface tension, fluid density, gravity, and the tube’s radius.

Another notable effect is the formation of menisci, the curved surfaces of a liquid near a wall or another object. A meniscus that curves upward indicates that the fluid wets the surface well, while a downward-curving meniscus suggests weaker adhesion compared to cohesion. This interplay of forces can be described by the Young-Laplace equation, which relates pressure differences across a curved interface to its curvature and surface tension.

## Young-Laplace Equation

The Young-Laplace equation provides a mathematical framework for understanding the pressure difference across a curved interface. It relates the pressure difference $\Delta p$ to the surface tension $\sigma$ and the radii of curvature $R_1$ and $R_2$:

$$\Delta p = \sigma \left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} \right).$$

If the interface is spherical, $R_1 = R_2 = R$, and the equation simplifies to:

$$\Delta p = \frac{2 \sigma}{R}.$$

This relationship explains why small bubbles or droplets have higher internal pressures than larger ones. Reducing the radius of a droplet increases the curvature and thus raises the pressure inside.

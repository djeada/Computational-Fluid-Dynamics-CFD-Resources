# Equation of State

## Overview

The equation of state provides the **thermodynamic closure** for the fluid mechanics equations by relating pressure, density, and temperature. It's essential for:
- **Compressible flow analysis** (density variations)
- **Thermodynamic property calculations** (speed of sound, specific heats)
- **Phase change phenomena** (vapor-liquid equilibrium)
- **Real gas effects** (high pressure, temperature conditions)

## General Concept

### Mathematical Form

A general equation of state relates thermodynamic state variables:
$$f(p, \rho, T) = 0$$

or in explicit forms:
$$p = p(\rho, T)$$
$$\rho = \rho(p, T)$$
$$T = T(p, \rho)$$

### Closure of Conservation Equations

The conservation equations provide:
- **Continuity**: Relates $\rho$ and $\vec{V}$
- **Momentum**: Relates $\vec{V}$ and $p$
- **Energy**: Relates $e$ (or $T$) and other variables

The equation of state **closes the system** by providing the $p$-$\rho$-$T$ relationship.

## Ideal Gas Law

### Basic Form

$$p = \rho R T$$

where:
- $p$ = pressure [Pa]
- $\rho$ = density [kg/m³]
- $R$ = specific gas constant [J/(kg⋅K)]
- $T$ = absolute temperature [K]

### Gas Constants

**Universal gas constant**: $R_u = 8314.5$ J/(kmol⋅K)

**Specific gas constant**: $R = R_u/M$ where $M$ is molar mass

**Common values**:
- Air: $R = 287.0$ J/(kg⋅K), $M = 28.97$ kg/kmol
- Helium: $R = 2077$ J/(kg⋅K), $M = 4.00$ kg/kmol
- Water vapor: $R = 461.5$ J/(kg⋅K), $M = 18.02$ kg/kmol

### Caloric Relations

For an ideal gas, internal energy depends only on temperature:
$$e = e(T) = c_v T + \text{constant}$$
$$h = h(T) = c_p T + \text{constant}$$

**Specific heat relation**:
$$c_p - c_v = R$$

**Specific heat ratio**:
$$\gamma = \frac{c_p}{c_v}$$

### Speed of Sound

For an ideal gas:
$$a^2 = \frac{\partial p}{\partial \rho}\bigg|_s = \gamma \frac{p}{\rho} = \gamma R T$$

Therefore:
$$a = \sqrt{\gamma R T}$$

## Isentropic Relations

### Basic Relations

For reversible, adiabatic (isentropic) processes:
$$p \rho^{-\gamma} = \text{constant}$$
$$T \rho^{-(\gamma-1)} = \text{constant}$$
$$p^{(\gamma-1)/\gamma} T^{-1} = \text{constant}$$

### Differential Forms

$$\frac{dp}{p} = \gamma \frac{d\rho}{\rho}$$
$$\frac{dT}{T} = (\gamma-1) \frac{d\rho}{\rho}$$
$$\frac{dp}{p} = \frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1} \frac{dT}{T}$$

### Applications

**Compressible flow analysis**:
- Isentropic nozzle flows
- Shock wave relations (combined with Rankine-Hugoniot)
- Expansion fan analysis

## Real Gas Effects

### Limitations of Ideal Gas Law

The ideal gas law fails when:
1. **High pressure**: Molecular volume becomes significant
2. **Low temperature**: Intermolecular forces become important
3. **Near critical point**: Phase change effects
4. **Very light molecules**: Quantum effects (e.g., hydrogen at low T)

### Van der Waals Equation

$$\left(p + \frac{a}{\bar{v}^2}\right)(\bar{v} - b) = RT$$

where:
- $\bar{v} = 1/\rho$ is specific volume
- $a$ = intermolecular attraction parameter
- $b$ = molecular volume parameter

**Physical meaning**:
- $a/\bar{v}^2$ term: Accounts for intermolecular attractions
- $b$ term: Accounts for finite molecular size

### Compressibility Factor

$$z = \frac{p\bar{v}}{RT} = \frac{p}{\rho RT}$$

**For ideal gas**: $z = 1$

**For real gases**: $z \neq 1$
- $z < 1$: Attractive forces dominate (low pressure/high temperature)
- $z > 1$: Repulsive forces dominate (high pressure/low temperature)

### Virial Equation

$$z = 1 + B(T)\rho + C(T)\rho^2 + \cdots$$

where $B(T)$, $C(T)$ are virial coefficients depending only on temperature.

### Redlich-Kwong Equation

$$p = \frac{RT}{\bar{v} - b} - \frac{a}{\sqrt{T}\bar{v}(\bar{v} + b)}$$

Better accuracy than van der Waals for many applications.

### Peng-Robinson Equation

$$p = \frac{RT}{\bar{v} - b} - \frac{a\alpha(T)}{\bar{v}(\bar{v} + b) + b(\bar{v} - b)}$$

Widely used in process engineering for hydrocarbon systems.

## Phase Equilibrium

### Clausius-Clapeyron Equation

For phase transitions:
$$\frac{dp_{sat}}{dT} = \frac{L}{T(\bar{v}_g - \bar{v}_l)}$$

where:
- $L$ = latent heat of vaporization
- $\bar{v}_g$, $\bar{v}_l$ = specific volumes of gas and liquid phases

### Critical Point

**Critical constants**: $T_c$, $p_c$, $\rho_c$

**Reduced properties**:
$$T_r = \frac{T}{T_c}, \quad p_r = \frac{p}{p_c}, \quad \rho_r = \frac{\rho}{\rho_c}$$

**Principle of corresponding states**: Fluids with same reduced properties have same compressibility factor.

### Two-Phase Flow

In the saturation region:
$$\rho = x\rho_g + (1-x)\rho_l$$
$$h = xh_g + (1-x)h_l$$

where $x$ is the dryness fraction (quality).

## Specific Applications

### High-Speed Aerodynamics

**Real gas effects** become important for:
- **Hypersonic flight**: $Ma > 5$, high temperature behind shock waves
- **Reentry vehicles**: Extreme heating, dissociation, ionization
- **Rocket nozzles**: High pressure and temperature conditions

**Modified relations**:
$$a^2 = \gamma \frac{p}{\rho} + \frac{\partial p}{\partial \rho}\bigg|_T \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial T}\bigg|_p \frac{T}{\rho}$$

### Gas Turbine Engines

**Combustion products**: Mixture of gases with varying composition
$$R_{mix} = \sum_i y_i R_i$$
$$\gamma_{mix} = f(T, \text{composition})$$

**Variable specific heats**: $c_p = c_p(T)$, $c_v = c_v(T)$

### Cryogenic Systems

**Liquid nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen**:
- Significant deviations from ideal gas behavior
- Phase change considerations
- Quantum effects for hydrogen

### Supercritical Fluids

**Above critical point**: No distinct liquid-gas phases
$$z = z(p_r, T_r)$$

Applications in supercritical extraction, power cycles.

## Computational Implementation

### Tabulated Data

**NIST databases**: Real fluid properties
- REFPROP: Reference fluid properties
- CoolProp: Open-source property database

**Implementation**: Interpolation routines for $p(\rho,T)$, $h(\rho,T)$, etc.

### Analytic Approximations

**Polynomial fits**:
$$c_p(T) = a_0 + a_1 T + a_2 T^2 + a_3 T^3 + \cdots$$

**NASA polynomials**: Standard format for combustion gases

### Iterative Procedures

For implicit equations of state:
$$F(p, \rho, T) = 0$$

Use Newton-Raphson or other root-finding methods.

## Numerical Methods

### Density-Based Solvers

**Conservative variables**: $(\rho, \rho \vec{V}, \rho E)$

**Equation of state**: $p = p(\rho, e)$ where $e = E - \frac{1}{2}V^2$

### Pressure-Based Solvers

**Primitive variables**: $(p, \vec{V}, T)$

**Density from EOS**: $\rho = \rho(p, T)$

### Preconditioning for Low Mach Number

**Artificial compressibility**: Modify time derivatives to improve conditioning
$$\frac{1}{\beta^2} \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \vec{V} = 0$$

where $\beta$ is artificial compressibility parameter.

## Measurement and Calibration

**Density**: Vibrating tube densimeters, buoyancy methods

### Derived Properties

**Specific heats**: Calorimetric methods

### Uncertainty Analysis

Propagation of measurement uncertainties through equation of state:
$$\delta p = \frac{\partial p}{\partial \rho}\delta \rho + \frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\delta T$$

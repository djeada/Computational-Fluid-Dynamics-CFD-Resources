# Fluid Statics

## Overview

Fluid statics (hydrostatics) studies fluids at rest or in equilibrium, where there are no velocity gradients and viscous stresses are absent. This fundamental area provides the foundation for understanding pressure distributions, buoyancy forces, and stability of floating bodies.

## Topics Covered

### Fundamental Concepts

- Stability of floating and submerged bodies
- Ship stability and naval architecture applications

## Mathematical Framework

### Hydrostatic Equation

For a fluid in gravitational equilibrium:
```
dp/dz = -ρg
```

For incompressible fluids:
```
p = p₀ + ρgh
```

For compressible fluids (atmospheric):
```
dp/dz = -ρ(z)g
```

### Buoyancy Force

Archimedes' principle:
```
F_b = ρ_fluid × g × V_displaced
```

### Metacentric Height

For floating body stability:
```
GM = BM - BG
```
where:
- BM = metacentric radius
- BG = distance from center of buoyancy to center of gravity

## Hydrostatic Forces

### Forces on Submerged Surfaces

**Flat surfaces:**
```
F = ρg h_c A
```
where h_c is the depth of the centroid.

**Center of pressure:**
```
y_cp = y_c + I_xx/(y_c A)
```

**Curved surfaces:**
- Horizontal component: Force on projected vertical area
- Vertical component: Weight of fluid above surface

# Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Resources

This repo is a work in progress aimed at gathering useful open-source resources for CFD engineers in one place. It includes notes, scripts, and tutorials for tools like ParaView, Gmsh, and more. The idea is to make it easier to find and use solid, practical materials without digging through scattered sources.

![cfd_resources](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac0cec05-abb0-4f8e-ae68-3df6bbb53308)

## Features

- Detailed explanations of complex CFD topics, including turbulence modeling, mesh generation, and solver algorithms.
- Custom scripts to streamline CFD workflows, including pre-processing, simulation, and post-processing tasks.
- Step-by-step guides on using ParaView for data visualization, Gmsh for mesh generation, and other CFD tools.

Navigate to the respective folders for detailed READMEs on how to use the materials.

## How to Contribute

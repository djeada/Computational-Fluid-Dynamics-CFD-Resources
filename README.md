## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>❓ Common Issues & Solutions</b></summary>

### Getting Started Problems

**Q: I'm overwhelmed. Where should I actually start?**
A: Start simple! Read the [Fundamentals](./notes/fluid_mechanics/intro.md), then run the [Lid-Driven Cavity](./scripts/simulations/lid_driven_cavity/) simulation. That's it for day 1. Build gradually.

**Q: I don't have a strong math background. Can I still learn CFD?**
A: Yes, but it will take more time. Start with the fundamentals and use online resources (Khan Academy, MIT OpenCourseWare) to fill gaps as needed. Focus on physical understanding first.

**Q: What programming language should I use?**
A: Python is recommended for beginners (used in this repo). MATLAB is also common in academia. For production CFD, C/C++ and Fortran are standard but not necessary for learning.

### Technical Issues

**Q: My simulation diverges. What should I check?**
A: Common causes (in order of frequency):
1. Time step too large (reduce by 10x and try)
2. Boundary conditions incorrect or conflicting
3. Initial conditions far from solution
4. Mesh quality poor (high skewness, aspect ratio)
5. Numerical scheme inappropriate for the problem

**Q: Results don't match theory/experiments. Why?**
A: Systematic debugging:
1. Verify geometry and mesh are correct
2. Check boundary conditions carefully
3. Ensure proper units and scaling
4. Verify convergence (residuals, monitors)
5. Compare turbulence model predictions
6. Assess if flow regime matches assumptions

**Q: Simulation takes forever. How to speed up?**
A:
1. Start with coarser mesh, refine only where needed
2. Use symmetry to reduce domain size
3. Choose efficient solver settings (multigrid, etc.)
4. Parallelize (MPI) if available
5. Consider steady-state instead of transient if appropriate
6. Use better initial guess (from similar case)

### Conceptual Questions

**Q: What's the difference between RANS, LES, and DNS?**
A: 
- **DNS** (Direct Numerical Simulation): Resolves all scales of turbulence. Very expensive, mostly for research. Think "perfect accuracy, impossible cost."
- **LES** (Large Eddy Simulation): Resolves large eddies, models small ones. Expensive but doable. Think "high accuracy, high cost."
- **RANS** (Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes): Models all turbulence effects. Industry standard. Think "reasonable accuracy, affordable cost."

**Q: Which turbulence model should I use?**
A: Quick guide:
- **k-ε**: General purpose, external flows, high Reynolds number
- **k-ω SST**: Boundary layers, separation, most versatile
- **Spalart-Allmaras**: Aerospace, external aerodynamics
- **LES**: Unsteady, complex geometries, when RANS fails
When in doubt, start with k-ω SST.

**Q: How do I know if my mesh is good enough?**
A: Perform mesh independence study:
1. Run simulation on your mesh
2. Refine mesh (2x points in each direction)
3. Compare key results (drag, pressure, etc.)
4. If <1-2% difference, original mesh is acceptable
5. Always check mesh quality metrics (skewness < 0.85, aspect ratio < 100)

**Q: What's Y+ and why does everyone talk about it?**
A: Y+ is a dimensionless wall distance. Critical for turbulence modeling:
- **Y+ < 1**: Resolve viscous sublayer (best accuracy, expensive)
- **30 < Y+ < 300**: Use wall functions (industry standard)
- **1 < Y+ < 30**: "Buffer layer" - avoid this range!

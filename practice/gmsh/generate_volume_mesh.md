# Volume Mesh Generation

Creating a volume mesh out of a surface mesh is a common task in computational sciences, especially when dealing with image segmentation resulting in a surface mesh, typically in STL format. While the surface mesh is suitable for printing or demonstration purposes, computational analysis, such as finite element analysis (FEA) for structural and heat transfer simulations or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, requires a volume mesh.

## Overview of GMSH

GMSH is a powerful tool for generating volume meshes. It allows users to open a mesh, define a volume, and generate a 3D mesh. The basic steps in the GUI are:

1. **Open the Mesh**: 
   - File -> Open

2. **Define the Volume**:
   - Physical groups -> Add -> Volume

3. **Generate the Mesh**:
   - Mesh -> 3D

4. **Adjust Global Mesh Size**:
   - Tools -> Options -> Mesh -> General -> Element size factor

However, using the GUI for complex surface meshes can lead to long waiting times. To optimize this process, GMSH provides a scripting language that allows for more efficient mesh generation.

## Using GMSH Scripting for Volume Mesh Generation

Here is a simple GMSH script to generate a volume mesh from a surface mesh:

```plaintext
Merge 'mesh_file.stl';
Surface Loop(1) = {1};
Volume(1) = {1};
```

Save this script in a file named meshing.geo and run the following command to generate the volume mesh, which will be saved as output.mesh:

```bash
gmsh meshing.geo -3 -o output.mesh
```

The `-3` flag indicates that a 3D mesh is to be generated.

## Detailed Steps for Scripting

1. **Merge the Surface Mesh**:
    - `Merge 'mesh_file.stl';` - This line imports the surface mesh file into GMSH.

2. **Create a Surface Loop**:
    - `Surface Loop(1) = {1};` - Defines a loop of surfaces that will be used to create the volume. Here, `{1}` refers to the identifier of the surface.

3. **Define the Volume**:
    - `Volume(1) = {1};` - Creates a volume from the surface loop.

By using this script, you can bypass the GUI and directly generate a volume mesh, significantly reducing processing time for complex morphologies.

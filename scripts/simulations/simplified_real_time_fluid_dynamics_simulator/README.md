The FluidSimulation class as a whole can be described as a solver that approximates fluid dynamics in a 2D environment using an Eulerian grid-based approach. It likely simulates aspects of the Navier-Stokes equations through diffusion, advection, and projection steps, albeit in a simplified form suitable for real-time simulations and visualizations.

Eulerian Approach

    The simulation uses an Eulerian framework. In Eulerian fluid simulations, the fluid's properties (such as velocity, pressure, and density) are tracked at fixed points in space (the grid cells), rather than following individual fluid particles. This is evident from how the properties like Vx, Vy, and density are associated with grid locations.

Navier-Stokes Equations

    While the full Navier-Stokes equations are not explicitly defined in your provided code, the simulation likely approximates aspects of these equations. The Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of viscous fluid substances and are fundamental in fluid dynamics. They account for forces like pressure, viscosity, and external forces, influencing fluid motion.

Diffusion and Viscosity

    Diffusion: This process, controlled by the diffuse method, simulates the spreading of fluid properties (like a dye in water). The algorithm used appears to be a form of iterative solver, likely a variant of the Jacobi method, to approximate the diffusion process over time.
    Viscosity: The simulation includes viscosity, a measure of a fluid's resistance to flow. Viscosity affects how momentum is transferred within the fluid, and in your code, it influences how velocity is diffused across the grid.

Advection

    The advect method in your class describes how properties like density and velocity are transported (carried) through the fluid over time. Advection is a core part of fluid simulations, representing the movement of fluid elements in space.

Projection and Pressure

    The project method aims to enforce incompressibility, ensuring that the velocity field respects the mass conservation principle. This step involves solving a Poisson equation for pressure. It's a crucial step to maintain realism in the simulation, preventing the fluid from unnaturally compressing or expanding.

Discretization and Time Stepping

    The simulation uses a discretized grid (a 2D array), with discrete time steps (dt). This approach is typical in computational simulations where continuous phenomena are approximated using discrete values.

Boundary Conditions

    The set_bnd function handles boundary conditions, which define how the fluid behaves at the edges of the simulation domain (the "box"). These conditions are important for realistically simulating how the fluid interacts with the walls of the container.

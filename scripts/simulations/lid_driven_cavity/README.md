### Problem Being Solved

The code simulates fluid flow over a flat plate using the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. This is a common problem in fluid dynamics, known as the lid-driven cavity problem. The problem involves computing the velocity and pressure fields within a cavity, where the top boundary (lid) is moved with a constant horizontal velocity while the other boundaries remain stationary. This setup creates complex flow patterns that are interesting to study for understanding fluid behavior in confined spaces.

### Approach Taken

1. **Discretization**:
   - The 2D domain is discretized into a grid of `N_POINTS x N_POINTS` (128x128 points in this case).
   - Each grid cell has a specified size (`element_length`) based on the `DOMAIN_SIZE`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Velocity fields (`u` and `v`) and pressure field (`p`) are initialized.
   - A small perturbation is added to the velocity field `u` to start the flow.

3. **Time Integration**:
   - The time-stepping method is used to evolve the velocity and pressure fields over `N_ITERATIONS` time steps.
   - A smaller `TIME_STEP` ensures stability in the numerical solution.

4. **Central Differences**:
   - Functions `central_difference_x` and `central_difference_y` compute the spatial derivatives of the velocity fields using central difference schemes.
   - The `laplace` function computes the Laplacian of a field, which is essential for diffusion terms in the Navier-Stokes equations.

5. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The function `apply_boundary_conditions` sets the velocity on the boundaries, enforcing the lid velocity on the top and zero velocities on the other boundaries.

6. **Pressure Poisson Equation**:
   - The function `solve_pressure_poisson` iteratively solves the Poisson equation for pressure, which ensures that the velocity field remains divergence-free (incompressible).

7. **Velocity Update**:
   - Tentative velocities are computed using the Navier-Stokes equations without the pressure gradient.
   - Pressure gradients are then used to correct the velocities to enforce incompressibility.

8. **Visualization**:
   - Matplotlib is used to create animated contour plots of the velocity fields (`u` and `v`) at each time step.
   - The `FuncAnimation` class updates these plots dynamically to show the evolution of the flow.

### Output

The output is an animation showing the evolution of the velocity fields `u` (horizontal component) and `v` (vertical component) over time. The animation provides insights into how the flow develops within the cavity:

- **Velocity Field Contours**: 
  - The contour plots display the distribution and magnitude of the velocity components `u` and `v`.
  - Initially, the flow starts with small perturbations, and as time progresses, the flow patterns become more pronounced.

- **Boundary Effects**:
  - The lid-driven boundary condition creates a shear layer at the top, which influences the entire flow within the cavity.
  - Recirculating vortices form near the stationary boundaries.

- **Iterative Convergence**:
  - The animation shows the iterative process over `N_ITERATIONS`, illustrating how the solution gradually approaches a steady-state or dynamically stable condition.

This simulation is a classic example of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques applied to study fluid behavior in a confined geometry. It demonstrates key concepts such as discretization, numerical stability, boundary conditions, and visualization of fluid flow.

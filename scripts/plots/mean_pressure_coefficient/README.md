    Data Lines:
        The black line with circular markers represents the experimental data (labeled as "Exp").
        The cyan line with circular markers represents the CFD simulation results (labeled as "CFD SRS").

    Annotations:
        The plot includes an annotation highlighting the separation plateau that is less pronounced in the simulation. This is marked with an arrow and text for emphasis.

    Axes and Titles:
        The x-axis is labeled as x [m]x [m].
        The y-axis is labeled as CP [−]CP​ [−].
        The plot title indicates that it represents the mean pressure coefficient along the upper-body centerline of a vehicle, with the centerline specified as y=0my=0m.

    Legend:
        The legend distinguishes between the experimental data and the CFD simulation results.

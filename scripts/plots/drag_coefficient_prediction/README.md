# Drag Coefficient Prediction

This project visualizes the relationship between the drag coefficient (\(C_d\)) and its predicted values (\(C_{d_{pred}}\)) using a scatter plot. The plot includes two sets of data points with different markers and colors, as well as linear regression lines to illustrate the trend for each dataset. The visualization is enhanced with titles, axis labels, a legend, and a grid for better readability.

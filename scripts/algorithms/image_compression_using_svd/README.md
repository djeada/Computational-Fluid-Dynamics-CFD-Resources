This project demonstrates the application of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for compressing grayscale images. By leveraging the mathematical properties of SVD, we can truncate the number of singular values used to reconstruct an image, effectively reducing its data size while preserving essential visual information. This method is explored by comparing the original image to its approximations at various ranks, showcasing how image quality improves with an increasing number of singular values.
